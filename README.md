# Roleplay Discord Server Bot 0.1.0
This project is made to help you provide an assisting bot to your roleplaying Discord server. It also offers a set of web pages to help your users retrieving every information about their characters. 
In the future, if possible, I hope to be able to offer a tracking system for your scenarios.

## Initialize the project
Refer yourself to the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/installation#configuration) to configure correctly the application.

## Initializing the bot
You'll have to get your bot client ID and put it in the .env file, as well as your Discord server's name in APP_NAME variable.

## Content of the API
This API contains what you'll need to have to start a role playing server on Discord :
* Character management
* Skill management
* Job management
* Inventory management
* Wounds management
* Family management

Discord Bot repository coming soon.
